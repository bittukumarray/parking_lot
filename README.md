# parking_lot
I have made these assumptions:

- Driver can't be under 18, if any request comes up with driver age below 18, I am not storing this detail and one message will be shown that "driver should be on or above 18 years old".
- Registration number must be unique
- Input format must be correct
- If slots get full and one more request comes to give a parking slot, "no slots available message will be generated"
